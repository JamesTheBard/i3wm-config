i3wm-config
===========

My i3wm configuration.  Figured it's easier to put my config here than PasteBin.

My Setup
--------

All of the files here are located in the $HOME/.i3 directory.  The .Xdefaults file and .xinitrc file are both in the $HOME/.i3 directory and are linked back to home via:

```bash
ln -s $HOME/.i3/.Xdefaults $HOME/.Xdefaults
ln -s $HOME/.i3/.xinitrc $HOME/.xinitrc
```
